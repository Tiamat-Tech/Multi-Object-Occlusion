### Abstract

Analyzing complex scenes with DNN is a challenging task, particularly when images contain multiple objects that partially occlude each other. Existing approaches to image analysis mostly process objects independently and do not take into account the relative occlusion of nearby objects. We propose a deep network for multi-object instance segmentation that is robust to occlusion and can be trained from bounding box supervision only.
